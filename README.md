# Chemical-Compatibility

A database for checking chemical compatibility with sample environment materials at ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source.

## Background

Experiments at ISIS have grown increasingly complex in recent years; one facet of this is the complexity of the chemical systems used. These experiments frequently utilise high temperatures and pressures, and ensuring the safety of experiments is a key concern. It is therefore vital for us to consider potential interactions between the chemicals used and the sample environment equipment we provide. A thorough understanding of these interactions enables engineers and technicians to design or select suitable equipment for a given experiment. 

Equipment we wish to consider includes:
- Gas handling panels
    - Stainless steel tubing (SS-316)
    - Pressure relief valves (SS-316, various elastomers)
    - Pressure transducers
    - Valves (SS-316, elastomers)
- Sample containers
    - Sample cells (various metals, alloys, glasses and plastics)
    - Container seals (various metals, elastomers)
- Vacuum pumps
- Gas cylinder regulators
- Pressure generators

In 2019, the ISIS Sample Environment Group created a simple spreadsheet to summarise the available literature for compatibility of the materials with various chemicals at room temperature. You can see a snapshot of this spreadsheet below.
