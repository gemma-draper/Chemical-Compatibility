# Chemical-Compatibility

A database for checking chemical compatibility with sample environment materials at ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source.

## Background

Experiments at ISIS have grown increasingly complex in recent years. One facet of this is the complexity of the chemical systems used. These experiments frequently utilise high temperatures and pressures Ensuring the safety of experiments is a key concern, so it is vital for us to consider potential interactions between the chemicals used and the sample environment equipment at ISIS. Understanding the compatibility of our systems with the chemicals used 

Equipment under consideration includes:
- Gas handling panels
    - Stainless steel tubing (SS-316)
    - Pressure relief valves (SS-316, various elastomers)
    - Pressure transducers
    - Valves (SS-316, elastomers)
- Sample containers
    - Sample cells (various metals, alloys, glasses and plastics)
    - Container seals (various metals, elastomers)

- Vacuum pumps

To this end, in 2019 the ISIS Sample Environment Group created a simple spreadsheet to summarise
